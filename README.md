### Installation via the WordPress admin panel

After downloading the **namba.zip** and **revellaction.zip** files to your computer just go to Appearance → Themes in your WordPress admin panel and choose the “Install themes“ tab menu. At the top of the page you find the smaller navigation link “Upload“. Via this link you choose to upload the **namba.zip** file and click the “Install now“ button. The **Namba theme** is now your active theme. Use the “Upload“ link again to upload the **revellaction.zip** file as well. Click the “Install now“ button. The **RevellAction child theme** is now your active theme.

### Installation via FTP

Alternatively you can also install the themes directly to your server using an FTP client (e.g. Filezilla). Just drop the **un-ziped Namba theme folder** and the **un-ziped RevellAction child theme folder** into your …/wp-content/themes/ folder. Now you can see the **Namba** and the **RevellAction** themes in your WordPress admin panel under Appearance → Themes → Available Themes. From here you can activate the **RevellAction theme**.

### Assets

The [assets](https://github.com/RevellAction/revellaction/tree/master/assets/) folder contains a .htaccess file and a robots.txt file you may copy in the WordPress root folder. The assets folder contains also the french translation of the Namba theme. You may copy the fr_FR.mo and fr_FR.po files into the wp-content/themes/namba/languages folder.
